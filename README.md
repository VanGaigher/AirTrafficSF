# Project: Analysis of Air Traffic in San Francisco

## Objective
This project aims to explore and analyze air traffic in San Francisco. We cover the following aspects:
- Analysis of traffic trends at San Francisco Airport;
- Identification of seasonal patterns and events impacting passenger flow;
- Assessment of demand for flights to Asian destinations;
- Strategic recommendations based on the conducted analyses.

## Tools Used
For analysis, we employed Pandas and Pyspark.

## Initial Data Exploration
We began with an exploratory analysis of the data in the 'Getting to Know Our Data' section, understanding its structure, data types, organization, and identifying missing or duplicate values.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
In this stage, we cleaned and preprocessed the data to make the most of it for analysis. We identified and handled missing values, standardized variables, and adjusted data formats.

## Supplementary Analysis
We conducted a more in-depth analysis through graphs to better understand the distribution of records in the dataframe.

## Descriptive and Correlation Analysis
We used descriptive statistics to determine means and standard deviations. Additionally, we explored correlations between variables to understand the impacts of changes in one type of data on others.

## Conclusions
- Higher frequency of international flights than domestic, with most flights having the US as the primary destination.
- Key destination regions: US, Asia, and Europe.
- Ticket prices are not particularly affordable, especially in the Low Fare category.
- Gradual increase in the number of passengers over the years, with 2014 registering the highest flow.
- Significant increase in records in June, July, and August, indicating higher demand during the American summer.
- Number of passengers per flight is influenced by fare and travel type (international or domestic).

These findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of air traffic at San Francisco Airport.
